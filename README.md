# fastify-local-server

This is a simple script to serve a local directory using [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/).

## How to use

If you want to create the executables:
- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run build-win` if you want to build the Windows executable, `npm run build-linux` if you want to build the Linux executable, `npm run build-mac` if you want to build the MacOS executable or `npm run build-all` if you want to build all of them.

Otherwise, just download the latest release and extract it.

Afterwards, simply move the executable for your platform to the directory you want to serve and run it.
